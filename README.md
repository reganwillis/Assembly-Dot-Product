# Assembly Dot Product
Analysis of the CPU performance and energy consumption of two different simulated processors as they compute the dot product of two vectors. Both processors use a subset of the MIPS ISA. One processor allows multiplication instructions and the other does not.

See the full performance analysis [here](docs/PerformanceAnalysis.pdf).

The [MARS MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/mars-mips-simulator.htm) was used for running the programs.
